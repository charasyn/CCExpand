# Example
This is a small example using several new custom control codes.

## Build
Either create a new CoilSnake project with all .ccs files added into the
`ccscript` directory, or compile `example.ccs` into an EarthBound ROM
manually, with however you normally compile CCScript files.

## Usage
Talking to Tracy will bring up the CCExpand test menu, where you will be
able to test out the newly added control codes. Please read `example.ccs`
for more information.
